# Assumption
 - Create triger in database for automatic updated stok after a successful transaction.
 - Create validation for transaction. If the user buys tickets with an amount that exceeds the stock, then the purchase fails and gives a message that the stock is insufficient, you can only buy tickets with the current available stock.
 - You can test all endpoint API in my server online with domain https://aw-myevent.herokuapp.com/ then followed by the routes available in your project
